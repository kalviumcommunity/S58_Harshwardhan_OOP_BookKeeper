# Simple Digital Library System in C++

This C++ program is like a simple digital version of a library. Imagine you have a bunch of books, and you need a system to keep track of them. This program helps you do just that!

## Features

### Add New Books
You can put new books into the library by typing in details like the title, author, and a special code called an ISBN.

### Remove Books
If a book is no longer in the library, you can take it out by using its ISBN.

### Search for Books
If you’re looking for a specific book, you can search for it by its title or the author’s name.

### List All Books
You can see a list of all the books in the library at any time.

## How It Works
Each book has its own "profile" with information like its title, author, and whether it's available for borrowing. The program uses these profiles to keep everything organized. 

You control the library using a simple menu where you pick what you want to do, like adding a new book or searching for one. You keep using the program until you decide to exit. 

It's like having your own little librarian inside your computer!
